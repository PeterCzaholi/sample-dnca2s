## Git Commit Guidelines
These have been imported from https://github.com/angular/angular.js

In order to provide a diciplined way of working, we defined rules on how git commit messages should be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
